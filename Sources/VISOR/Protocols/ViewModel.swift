import Observation

// MARK: - ViewModel

/// The base protocol for all ViewModels in the VISOR architecture.
///
/// Conforming types are explicitly MainActor-isolated `@Observable` classes
/// with a stable routed `State` instance and an optional `Action` enum for
/// user-initiated mutations. `@ViewModel` generates the State gateway,
/// observation recipe, ownership token and stable `bindings` namespace.
///
/// - ViewModels use a plain nested `final class State` retained by a stored
///   `let state` property.
/// - Actions are dispatched via `handle(_:)`. Implement sync or async as needed.
/// - State changes use generated mutation selectors; UI action proposals use `bindings`.
