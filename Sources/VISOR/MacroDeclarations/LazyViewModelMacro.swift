// MARK: - Single ViewModel Macro

/// Attach to a View struct to enable lazy view model initialisation.
/// Auto-generates factory environment, viewModel property, and body.
///
/// The generated body performs lazy initialisation once, then delegates
/// observation to VISOR's structured, readiness-gated owner through an opaque
/// runtime bridge.
///
/// **View/Content pattern:**
/// ```swift
/// @LazyViewModel(DashboardViewModel.self)
/// struct DashboardView: View {
///   var content: some View {
///     DashboardContent(state: state) { action in
///       Task { await viewModel.handle(action) }
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Generated `@State` retains one ViewModel for the annotated view's SwiftUI
/// structural identity. The Content view is a pure function of state +
/// onAction, trivially previewable with static state and no factory.
/// Observation shares that structural lifetime: navigation covering and tab
/// switches do not withdraw retained content or restart initial reactions.
/// Actual removal cancels observation; explicit scene pauses still withdraw
/// content and reconcile fresh snapshots before restoring it.
///
/// **Read-only state:** Use the generated `state` alias for reading:
/// ```swift
/// Text(state.title)
/// ```
///
/// **Bindings:** Use `bindings` for properties selected by `@StateBinding` actions:
/// ```swift
/// Toggle("Enabled", isOn: bindings.isEnabled)
/// TextField("Name", text: bindings.name)
/// ```
///
/// The default owner UI remains visually transparent while observation becomes
/// ready and shows a generic unavailable state after an infrastructure failure.
/// Use the custom-presentation overload when genuinely slow preparation needs
/// visible pending UI or the feature needs its own failure copy or layout;
/// ordinary domain failures still belong in ViewModel State.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - viewModelType: The concrete ViewModel type instantiated and retained in generated `@State`.
///   - observationPolicy: Controls whether observation pauses based on scene phase.
///     Defaults to `.alwaysObserving`. Use `.pauseInBackground` or `.pauseWhenInactive` for
///     view models driving high-frequency work that wastes resources when the UI is not visible.
///
/// > The generated `viewModel` property fails with a diagnostic precondition if accessed
/// > before initialisation. The generated `body` renders `content` only while the backing
/// > `@State` contains a ViewModel; its task creates that instance when the owner mounts.

/// Custom-presentation form of ``LazyViewModel(_:observationPolicy:)``.
///
/// The pending and failure views replace VISOR's defaults after the ViewModel
/// has been created. The brief transparent pre-construction state is retained.
/// Use visible pending UI only when preparation is expected to be perceptible,
/// supply it with a meaningful accessibility label, and make a custom failure
/// view explain the unavailable state without creating a dead end.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - viewModelType: The concrete ViewModel type instantiated and retained in generated `@State`.
///   - observationPolicy: Controls whether observation pauses based on scene phase.
///   - pending: UI shown while VISOR reconciles initial observation state.
///   - failure: UI shown when VISOR can no longer guarantee coherent State.
